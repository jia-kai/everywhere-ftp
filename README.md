# everywhere-ftp
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/everywhere-ftp

This is a standalone project containing both FTP client and
server. It is a project on the networking course, but I hope it could be robust
enough for daily use, especially for dropping a temporary light-weight FTP
server anywhere.
